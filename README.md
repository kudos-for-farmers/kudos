# kudos - upgrade our food system

### Rewards and Incentivization for Farmers and Supporters of our Food System

## Overview 

The scaffold-eth user experience will be simplified in a way that the user will not be aware that they are using web3 technologies and modern approaches.  The UI will be familiar, requiring only an email address for login with a Magic Link.  Tokens will be held in "no-custodial" wallets; private keys will not be known or necessary as the tokens are unable to be transferred.  Users can be airdropped rewards, or will be able to scan a QR code to validate participation.  We may consider adding options for participants to control their wallets but the current priority is ease of use and lowering barriers to entry. 

A bigger picture aspect which will be developed with the input of stakeholders across the state is a new LCA/DAO for the agrigultural community.  This will provide a novel way for everyone directly involved in our ecosystem to contribute to the success of Colorado agriculture.

We will use the guild model to identify any group involved in Colorado agriculture.  Based on the desires of the greater community, guilds will be incentivized to perform certain activities which will grant them the ability to recognize contributors using our "Guild kudos" token.  Because kudos are valuable to contributors, farmers and others will be motivated to align with the DAO.  This is a novel mechanism for aligning regional and local interests by harnessing the power of those who are already contributing.

Digging deeper into the tech, both guilds and dao's will be managed using the DX DAO guild and daostack models.  A future state may allow members to govern locally as well as at the regional or even global level.  This framework also allows for automated verification of proposals requiring kudos distributions.
